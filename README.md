# Pretzel.Image
An image tag for Pretzel

This plugin aims at creating an image tag that is more extensive that the markdown one.

### Usage

The syntax is the following :

`{% img path/to/file [class(es)] [width [height]] %}`

Be sure to enclose your classes in quotes if there is more than one.

### Installation

Download the latest [release](https://github.com/k94ll13nn3/Pretzel.Image/releases) and copy `Pretzel.Image.dll` to the `_plugins` folder at the root of your site folder.
